# Example Inference Data

The real world datasets, used in the paper, cannot be freely distributed (although they are publicly available). Hence, we prepared a small snippet of data from the simulator CARLA. If you want to quickly test the inference code (see ocamo/matlab/inference or ocamo/python/inference), please download and extract data from [here](https://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~moravj34/data/carla_example.zip).
